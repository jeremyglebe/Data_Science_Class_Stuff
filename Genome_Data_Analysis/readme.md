# Example Code of Regression Model & Correlation
Example comes from our textbook. (Big Data Science & Analytics A Hands-On Approach, Arshdeep Bahga, Vijay Madisetti) It had to be modified to run and I also added a lot of print statements and timers for me.
### I DID NOT WRITE THIS PROGRAM (I only modified it as necessary, or for some experimentation)
